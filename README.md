This simple calculator was first built for a Free Code Camp project similar to
[this one](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator).

The page is built in HTML5 and CSS, using Bootstrap. The calculator is built in
JavaScript. It was originally built in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ogdendavis/pen/qpgyBw).

The main modifications I made to this project to bring it off of CodePen were
updating index.html to include basic HTML structure and links to the stylesheet
and scripts.

In October 2018, I modified the app to also fulfill the requirements for the
calculator assignment from The Odin Project.
